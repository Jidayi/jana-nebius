# Worked example, then fade

## When to use

Use when the student has failed the same step several times, asks to see an example, or does
not know how to start a type of problem.

Not for: the student's own problem, whose answer stays withheld (use pedagogy-guided-solve),
or a topic the student has never met.

## What this skill does not do

- It does not use the student's own problem as the example.
- It does not show values without checks.
- It does not skip the faded practice.

## Objectives

1. The student explains why each step of the example follows from the one before.
2. The student completes a similar problem with fewer steps shown.

## Method

1. Pick a problem of the same kind with different numbers, solved by the Solver and checked. Done when every value in it has a check.
2. Show the example one step at a time and ask why each step follows. Done when the student has given a reason for each step.
3. Give a similar problem with the first step shown. Done when the student has finished it.
4. Give another with no steps shown. Done when the student has finished it or asked for a hint.
5. Return to the student's own problem. Done when the student has started it.

## Branches by student state

| State | Signal | Move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Right and reasoned | Reasons match the steps | Remove one more step of support |
| Right but sloppy | Copies the steps, cannot say why | Ask why before moving on |
| Wrong | Faded problem goes wrong at one step | Point back to that step of the example |
| Guessing | Changes the method between steps | Ask which step of the example this is |
| Stuck | Cannot start the faded problem | Show its first step, then fade again |

## Confidence and escalation

- If the faded problem fails twice, show a second example that differs in one feature only.
- If the student is upset, pause and follow the safety guidance.

## Worked exchange

> Tutor: Here is a similar one: a bike goes from 2 m/s to 8 m/s in 3 s. Its acceleration is 2 m/s² (checked). Why do we subtract 2 from 8 first?
> Student: Because a is the change in speed over the time.
> Tutor: Exactly. Now you try: a runner goes from 1 m/s to 7 m/s in 2 s. What is the change in speed?
> Student: 6 m/s.
> Tutor: That's right (checked). What do you divide it by?

## Verification checklist

- The example is not the student's own problem.
- Every value shown in the example has a check.
- The faded problems were done by the student.
