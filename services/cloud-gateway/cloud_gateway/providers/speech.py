"""The three speech services behind cloud voice (VOC-28, D124), as interfaces the voice connection drives.

  Recognizer   streaming speech to text with voice-activity events (Cloud Speech-to-Text v2, Chirp)
  Live         the voice: reads accepted sentences aloud and reports what it said (Gemini Live, native audio)
  Synthesizer  verbatim streaming text to speech, the fallback voice (Cloud Text-to-Speech, Chirp 3 HD)

The real adapters are in `google_speech.py` and `gemini_live.py`; tests give fakes with the same shape. Nothing here
holds audio or text beyond the call that carries it, and nothing here logs either."""
