"""Quantities with units inside equations (VER-17 with VER-11 and VER-12), and given numbers as exact values.

A motion problem is solved by `math_solve` with its knowns given as quantities ("72 km/h"), each converted exactly to
SI base units before solving, and each unknown asked for in a stated unit. Before anything is substituted, every
equation is checked for dimensional consistency: both sides, and every pair of added terms, must have the same
dimension, otherwise the call is a `DOMAIN_ERROR` naming both dimensions (for example "found m s⁻¹, expected m").
An unknown is solved in its stated unit by scaling its symbol, so a speed asked for in km/h comes back in km/h."""
