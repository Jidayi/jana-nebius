"""Every tool the S1 build ships, declared once, grouped by toolset (TOL-01, TOL-05).

Metadata comes from the tool register (generated into `agent_core.tools.generated.register`) and argument schemas
for worker tools from the worker's own schemas (`generated.worker_schemas`), so neither can drift. Descriptions follow
the sections of LIST TOL-07a. Host and client executors that belong to later milestones (the skill loader, M4; the
board and question cards, M5) are not wired yet: those tools stay hidden until then. The memory toolset rides in this
build ahead of its register stage (`registry.EARLY_TOOLS`), hidden the same way until the engine binds its handlers
(TOL-23)."""
