"""The study planner (LRN-28 to LRN-32): optional plans proposed by code from the learner model; a model may only
phrase them.

`plan` is a pure function of a `PlannerState` (what the learner model, the profile and the packs say today) and the
settings. It returns the next activity first and the optional blocks after it, each with an approximate duration
(an estimate that sizes the suggestion and never stops work, D54), plus three ranked alternatives for the main
block. There is no daily cap: every further request plans again from the current state, at any hour.

- Warm-up: due review cards (exam-capped, LRN-13), lowest retrievability first, at most `review_cap_items` and at
  most `review_cap_share` of the plan's estimated minutes; the rest wait for later suggestions (LRN-29), unless the
  student asks for every due review now.
- Main: the KC maximising exam_weight x (1 - P) x (1 + boost x failed_recently) among the subjects chosen for this
  suggestion, replaced by its weakest prerequisite when a prerequisite is under the readiness bar; a lesson when the
  KC is not started, else practice. A KC whose stuck-cap revisit date has come is revisited first. After a mock, the
  KCs of its questions that lost marks are practised first until they are secure (ASM-20; D102). The student's own
  topic choice replaces it.
- Mixed: interleaved items from mastered KCs confusable with the main KC.
- Reflect: the bars that moved today.
- At most `planner_max_subjects` subjects per suggestion, ranked by days to exam then weakness and rotated by the
  plans already taken today.
- Phases (TABLE LRN-30a, nearest exam among the profile's subjects): `countdown` puts a timed mixed paper in place of
  the main block once every `phase_mock_every_days`; `final` serves only KCs with recent errors (no new KC unless the
  student chose it) and a full mock in place of the mixed block on the same rhythm; `exam_day` offers only an
  optional light review.
- Exam dates (LRN-44): in the `exam_frontload_days` before the nearest exam the learner set, the main block comes
  from that subject's weakest KCs (in the final days, when none has a recent error, its weakest started KC, never a new
  one), and a mock's follow-up from another subject waits.
