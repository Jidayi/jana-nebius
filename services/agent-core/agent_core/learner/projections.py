"""Projections: learner tables folded from the event log (DAT-05, LRN-02).

Each projection owns tables and folds events in the merged order (hlc, device_id, origin_seq). The projector records
in `projection_state` the projection's code version, the hash of the mastery parameters and pinned content, the last
local `seq` folded and the full merge cursor. An event that sorts before the cursor (a late event from another
device), or one that changes how earlier events read (a re-mark or its evidence, ASM-23, CUR-36), makes the
projection replay instead of folding, so incremental and rebuilt tables are always equal. A rebuild runs in one
transaction: readers on other connections keep the previous tables until it commits.

The projections are `attempts`, `kc_mastery` (with `subject_ability` and the FSRS `review_cards`, LRN-13), `notes`,
`learner_misconceptions`, `preferences`, `study_plans` (LRN-28, LRN-31) and `engagement` (`engagement_state` and
`engagement_daily`: streaks with freeze, frustration and confidence bias; LRN-16, LRN-33). Where a fold reads a table
another projection owns (the engagement projection reads the day's checked attempts and completed plan blocks), it
reads only rows stamped at or before the event, so folding it alone or with the others gives the same rows.

    A plan is `proposed` when generated; `start`, `change` and `not_today` decisions set `started`, `changed` and
    `not_today` (a change also generates the changed plan as a new proposal). Once started, each checked opportunity
    on a block's KCs counts towards the first unfinished block that lists one of them; a block is complete at its
    target, a reflection when every other block is, and the plan is `done` when all are. Completed work is never
    undone: stopping leaves the plan `started` with its finished blocks, and resuming continues at the first
    unfinished one."""

    A day counts for the streak with one completed plan block or `streak_min_minutes` of checked work; opening the
    app alone does not (LRN-33). When a day counts, the days missed since the last one are covered by freezes when
    enough are left, else the streak starts again at 1 (shown as "New streak: day 1", never as a loss). A freeze is
    earned each week (`streak_weekly_freezes`, or `support_weekly_freezes` while attendance was below
    `support_min_days_per_week` in each of the last `support_weeks` weeks, LRN-27), up to `streak_max_freezes`.

    `frustration` is an exponentially weighted average of frustration signals over closed attempts and help events
    (half-life `frustration_half_life_events`, LRN-16): a wrong answer after a hint, a bottom-out and a gaming flag.
    `confidence_bias` is the mean of self-rated confidence (1-3 as 0, 0.5, 1) minus the outcome over the last
    `confidence_bias_window` rated attempts."""
