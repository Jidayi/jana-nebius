"""Every store that can hold a profile's data, in one registry that profile deletion and the retention job both walk
(DAT-08, DAT-09, DAT-14, MEM-22, UIA-06, UIA-08).

Each `ProfileStore` names what it holds, where it lives, the eraser that removes it when the profile is deleted, and
its row of TABLE DAT-08a (`retention.RULES`, by row class) or, for a store no retention row governs, how long it
lives. The retention job applies the rows in the registry's order (`retention_order`); profile deletion runs each
eraser once, in `ERASERS` order (`Erasers.erase`): what the process holds in memory first, the files and rows on disk
last, so nothing re-creates what was already erased.

Erasers are registered by the component that owns the data (`Erasers.register`); a name that is not an eraser of
the registry is refused, so a new store has to be listed here before anything can erase it.
`tests/test_a1_erasure.py` fails when a retention row, a file holding a profile's text or an eraser is not accounted
for here."""
