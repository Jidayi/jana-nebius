"""The stores of one installation, opened at start (DAT-01): `device.db` and the learner database of the local profile.

Profiles with names, PINs and per-profile keys arrive in M10; until then the installation has one local profile,
found by its directory under `profiles/` or created on first start. Every migration either database receives is
recorded in the device database's ledger (DAT-12).

A `device.db` that fails its integrity check never stops the app (UXS-47, DAT-13, D84): it is set aside beside the
original, never deleted, a fresh one takes the defaults of TABLE PLT-17b with every online feature off, and the
student profiles are listed again from their own learner databases, whose learning data is untouched.
