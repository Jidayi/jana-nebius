"""Signed, immutable speech packs (VOC-02/03). No network or model download path.

Speech weights have their own manifest: the tutor model's 7B floor and model-pack role restrictions remain intact.
A speech pack ships the native voice sidecar, so it is an executable artefact: only an updater-purpose intermediate may
sign it (`speech_pack`, TABLE SEC-12a, D88). Install and every launch check that signature against the device's live
revocation list (SEC-16), the licences, the selected class, the upstream pin and every installed byte.

Licences (VOC-02, D95): model files carry a LIST SEC-24a licence; the runtime (the `sidecar` role: interpreter,
libraries, our launcher) carries a SEC-23 shipped-artefact licence, or an LGPL licence under the D95 conditions: a
separate library in a folder of its own that holds nothing else, its licence text shipped beside it, and never a
model or the entry point. GPL, AGPL and unknown licences are refused everywhere.
