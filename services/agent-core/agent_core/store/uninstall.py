"""Uninstall and data removal (PLT-24, SEC-17, DAT-09, DAT-11).

The uninstaller removes the binaries, the packs and models, and every cache, and asks the adult whether to keep or
delete the learner data ("keep" or "delete"). Deleting removes the device and learner databases, every other file of
the data folder, and every key the app holds by reference (the key store's `jana.*` entries: the install marker, the
device key, profile keys, the service credential). Keeping leaves the learner data and its keys for a reinstall.

Before deleting, `preflight` says whether an enabled personal online feature still holds queued tombstones (DAT-11):
the uninstaller then asks the adult to connect once so they are delivered, and says so when that is not possible.

The Windows uninstallers run `agent-core --uninstall keep|delete --data-dir DIR [--keystore-dir DIR]`; on macOS and
Linux the app offers the same from Settings before the app is moved to the bin.
