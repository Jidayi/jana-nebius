"""Opening and migrating the SQLite stores (DAT-03, DAT-12).

Every connection gets the contract's pragmas. A database's schema version is `PRAGMA user_version`: it lives in the
file header, so it changes in the same transaction as the migration that sets it. Migrations are forward-only and
numbered; each runs as one transaction, statement by statement (a script runner that commits between statements
would leave half a migration behind). Before migrating an existing file the runner writes a copy beside it and keeps
it until the next successful open. A file newer than this app is refused and left untouched. Encryption at rest
(SQLCipher, DAT-02) arrives in M10; until then the copies are plain like the databases they copy.
