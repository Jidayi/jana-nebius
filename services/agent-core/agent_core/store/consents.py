"""Consent, one scope per feature (PRV-05, PRV-06, ARC-11, D43, D53).

Profile scopes live in the profile's learner database (`consents`); the device scopes `telemetry` and `crash_reports`
in `device_consents`. A grant records who gave it, how, the version of the plain-words notice shown and the DPIA
reference; with no DPIA reference configured nothing can be granted (PRV-08, D13). Withdrawal is one step: the active
row is marked withdrawn, and a scope whose data may sit at a destination queues a withdrawal notice in the outbox
(DAT-11). Refusing every scope leaves local tutoring working: nothing on the local path reads a consent."""
