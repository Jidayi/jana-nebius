"""The retention job: TABLE DAT-08a as data, applied to one profile's learner database, the device database and the
profile's attachment and spill folders (DAT-08, MEM-22).

`RULES` has one entry per row of the table, in the order the job applies them. A rule without a `purge` is never
touched by the job: its rows go only by profile deletion (DAT-09), uninstall (PLT-24) or the feature that owns them.
Every period is a configuration key (D53: fixed defaults, never a user setting). A row is removed when its expiry is
at or before `now_ms`, and never before. Purging a transcript keeps the session row, its title and summary, and every
event, so the projections derived from events do not change.

The runtime calls `run_retention` at app start and every `retention_job_interval_h` hours. It walks the rules in
the order of the registry of profile stores (`store.profile_stores`), the same registry profile deletion walks.
