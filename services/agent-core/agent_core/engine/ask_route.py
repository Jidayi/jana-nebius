"""Where the one Home input sends what the student typed (UXS-67, STU-20, D117).

Three ways out, chosen by the content and never by a model:

- `tutor`: a problem or a question in an installed subject. Homework is never simply answered: the guided tutor takes
  it (PED-01, D87). When in doubt between the tutor and Ask anything, the tutor wins.
- `study`: material (a link, or a pasted passage) opens the study area (STU-01).
- `ask`: any other question goes to the online feature `ask_anything` (STU-20).

The decision is lexical and local, so it works offline and costs nothing: the question's content words are looked up
in the installed packs' curriculum vocabulary (node titles and descriptions, knowledge-component statements, lesson,
worked-example and misconception passages). A question is in a subject when enough of its words are curriculum words
of that subject, or when it is problem-shaped (numbers with units, an equation, an imperative such as "solve") and at
least one of its words is. The packs the index holds are the installed ones, so an uninstalled subject never routes
to the tutor."""
