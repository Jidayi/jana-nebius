"""The turn engine for the S1 guided solve (AGT-03 to AGT-08, AGT-11 to AGT-13, AGT-16, AGT-28, API-10, PED-03,
PED-05, PED-08, PED-10).

Code decides the flow; models fill content. The flow below is the engine's: a new problem is solved by the Solver
(every value from a tool), verified (each value matched to its check, then a Checker verdict), and taught by the Coach
one step at a time. The student's attempts are checked by code; the hint rung, the step and what is withheld are
engine state. A model's text cannot move the flow, call another role or change what it may call.

A Coach turn runs Prepare → Call → Normalise → (Tool round → Prepare)* → Stop gates → Finalise. Its candidate stays
in a private buffer until every gate passes (API-10); only then do text, board and card events reach the stream."""
