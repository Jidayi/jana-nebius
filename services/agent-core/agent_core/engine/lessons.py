"""The lesson flow on a session (AGT-22, TOL-22): a session opened with `origin.kind: lesson` plays the lesson's pack
blocks in order through the engine.

"Next" (`next_step`) opens the lesson at its saved block, or moves to the next one; the block index is saved at every
move (MEM-02), so a lesson resumes where it stopped. Each move rewrites the session plan with `lesson_plan_write`,
called by engine code only (TOL-22), and shows it as the `plan` card. The Coach phrases and paces a text block (the
idea, the worked example, the common mistakes, a visual's caption, the summary); a check block (prior knowledge, a
guided step, a quick check, the exit check, and a step-shape lesson's step and check, D110) opens its item as the
open problem, so the deterministic marker marks the answer (the Checker's part, ASM-02) and the leak gate guards its
key (AGT-09). A question the student asks mid-lesson is answered as a side question (AGT-18); a new problem is kept
to try after the lesson.

Everything a block says is the pack's reviewed text: its numbers are the block's own, so they trace to it like a
question's numbers do (AGT-10). No model chooses a block, its order or when the lesson moves on (AGT-03)."""
