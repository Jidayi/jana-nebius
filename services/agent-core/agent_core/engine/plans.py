"""The plan desk: optional daily plans, the student's choices, the support level, reminders and the progress view
(LRN-27 to LRN-35, UXS-12, UXS-27).

Every proposal is computed by code (`agent_core.learner.planner`) from the learner model at this moment and
appended as a `plan_generated` event with a new `plan_id`; the student's Start, Change and Not today are
`plan_decision` events, and a change also generates the changed plan as a new proposal (LRN-31). The `study_plans`
projection keeps each plan with its decision and its blocks' progress, so stopping keeps finished work and the next
read resumes at the first unfinished block. Nothing here limits learning: a plan can be asked for at any hour, as
often as wanted, with no PIN and no daily cap (D54, D86), and it all works offline.

The Home plan card is `card_plan` (events contract); its request id is `req_` + the plan id, answered through the
existing card-answer route (`POST /v1/cards/{request_id}/answer`): action `start`, action `change` with option
`alt_0`..`alt_2` or `shorten`, or `skipped: true` for Not today.
