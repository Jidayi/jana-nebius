"""The S1 slice flows beyond guided solve: check my working (AGT-21 and ASM-09, S1 subset) and practice help (AGT-23,
S1 subset), for the S1 topic only. The full flows arrive with M12 and M14.

Check my working: each line of the student's working is checked by code. A line with the same unknowns as the line
before it goes to `math_check_step` (VER-06): valid, or invalid with its error category. A line the step checker
cannot relate to the one before (it substitutes values into a formula) is solved for the problem's unknown with
`math_solve`, and is valid when its solution is the plan's checked answer; for simultaneous equations it is valid when
it holds at the checked solution. A line substituting the board's givens into the formula before it (`v = 0 + 2*5`
after `v = u + a*t`) is valid when it holds at the formula's value for its subject at those givens. Lines are never
matched against the plan's own route, so any valid method passes (ASM-09, `asm09_alternative_methods`). The first
invalid line is the first error; later lines are checked against the line before them (error carried forward). A
formula line with no numbers is shown unchecked. Every result carries the check id of the tool call that decided it.

Practice help: the item's stored, build-verified solution is the plan (no Solver call). An answer is marked by the
deterministic marker against the item's key and marking rule (CUR-15, ASM-02); hints come from the item's authored
ladder, which the Coach only rephrases (PED-04); an attempt comes before the first hint (PED-05).
