"""What the health panel reads (OBS-15) from the API it already has.

`GET /v1/health` carries a map of component to `ok`, `degraded`, `down` or `starting`, so each condition the panel
names is a component of its own; the client turns each problem component into one plain line with one action:

    worker            the tool worker answers (`down` while its circuit is open or no worker started)
    sandbox           `degraded` when a worker runs without its OS sandbox (SEC-06)
    keychain          `degraded` unless the shell keeps every device secret in the OS keychain (SEC-17, D97): the
                      file fallback, a secret the shell could not store, or a development build's memory store
    runtime_fallback  `degraded` when the runtime serves the next smaller model, not the plan's first (MDL-19)
    runtime_variant   `degraded` when the runtime runs on a llama.cpp build other than the first choice because that
                      one failed its touch generation (PLT-04); the build and why are in the hardware report
    class_lower       `degraded` when more than `class_suggest_lower_share` of the window's guided steps ran over the
                      class's budget: the panel suggests a lower class (PLT-09, `router.hardware.suggest_lower`)
    speed             `degraded` when the median guided step or first-words time of the last `health_window_days`
                      is over the hardware class's budget (AGT-28), once `health_min_turns` turns are recorded

`runtime`, `storage`, `capture` and `learner_store` are set elsewhere (MDL-19, DAT-13). `GET /v1/models` carries the
hardware class and why (`recommended.reason_key`), and the installed models with the model pack's version. The
hardware report (`router.hardware.report`: the failed minimum-laptop checks with their figures, the benchmark, the
student's class choice, the tutor's path and the runtime build with its fallbacks) is `ModelCatalogue.hardware`
(PLT-08, PLT-29; D76); it is sent when the bundled contract declares it.
