"""Where a voice conversation lives (VOC-53, D130): the open chats only.

`ask` is the Home box and its Ask anything answer view (STU-20, UXS-67); `study` is a study set's Chat tab (STU-21),
naming the open source, its revision and the open grant a private source needs (STU-19). A socket with no place serves
read-aloud and dictation only. The spoken forms here are built from accepted replies only: an Ask anything answer that
passed `compose`, a chat aid the study checker kept, or a fixed line; never model text that skipped a gate (VOC-33).
