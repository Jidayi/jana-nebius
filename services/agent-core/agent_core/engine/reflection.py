"""The background Reflector (AGT-26, MEM-06 to MEM-12, MEM-22, TOL-23).

Notes are written at four points only (MEM-06): the end of a problem, the end of a session (or a long pause), the end
of onboarding, and an explicit request from the student. Each point makes one Reflector job. The jobs wait in one
device-wide `ReflectorQueue`:

- **Gates.** Memory saving on; a capture filter loaded; not a content-only device; a local Reflector candidate (never
  a cloud one, MDL-25); no safety flag in the job's window. A window the student kept out (saving off, a safety flag)
  is marked done, so it is never reflected later.
- **Scheduling.** A job starts only when no turn is active and `reflector_idle_delay_s` has passed since the last
  activity (an explicit request skips the delay). `start_turn` pauses the queue: a running job is cancelled and put
  back at the front, to run again in the next idle period; its model call runs at the router's background priority,
  so a Coach call never waits behind it (MDL-22). Activating another profile cancels the previous profile's jobs. The
  queue is deduplicated by job key (profile, session, point, cursor), and a job whose window has no new learning
  events is skipped (the cursor is the newest event the job covered, kept in the learner database's audit log in the
  same transaction as the notes). An explicit request's job keeps its own audit entry and never moves that cursor:
  the evidence before it is still reflected at the next write point. A forget while a job runs cancels it and puts it
  back (its view of the notes is stale); a job started `reflector_max_starts` times is left for the next write point.
- **The call.** Structured output against the Reflection contract with no tools offered; minimal prompt mode; the
  task built by code (`memory.reflect_input`). An output that breaks the contract, or names a number outside the lists
  it was shown, fails whole; one correction retry, then the job is dropped (MEM-08).
- **Apply.** Through the `memory_note` handler with role `reflector` (role `student_request` for a note the student
  asked for), in one transaction: notes, bounds (after one consolidation call when the bounds need it, MEM-12), the
  session summary (the Reflector's when it passes the filter, else one built by code, MEM-22) and the job cursor.
  Once the apply starts, a pause no longer cancels the job, so a note is never written twice.
- **Announce.** A note the student asked for is announced as `memory.saved` with its Undo window (MEM-11); background
  notes are silent. A request that ends with nothing kept (no evidence to cite, a rule refused it, saving went off,
  no local model, too many restarts) is declined with the fixed notice, in the turn that asked (G91).
- **Trace.** Each job is a `kind=job` trace with one gate entry per check and counts only: no note text, no student
  text, in any trace or log line.

`reflect` runs one job outside the queue (the live memory evaluation calls it the same way the queue does).
