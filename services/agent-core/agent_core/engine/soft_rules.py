"""The soft rule matching pipeline of each Coach turn (PED-15), with the signals of TABLE PED-14a.

Per turn: (1) filter by scope and status; (2) evaluate code predicates; (3) send the judged candidates, at most the
configured number, to one batched yes/no call (the `rule_matcher` auxiliary role on the local fast tier, AGT-02);
(4) relationships and PED-12; (5) frequency limits; (6) inject at most the configured number of rules within the token
budget into the per-turn tutor-context block (PRM-15). On the low hardware class, with no judge bound, or on a timeout
or a reply that does not parse, judged conditions fall back to the rules' keywords, and high-criticality rules that
cannot be judged default to active. The cloud tier is never needed; matched ids and reasons go to the turn trace."""
