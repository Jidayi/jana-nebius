"""A session's view of the student's memory (MEM-03, MEM-11, MEM-13, MEM-14, PRM-17, TOL-23).

`SessionMemory` freezes the learner snapshot at the session's first Coach prepare and renders the learner block (tier
6) from it for each call's variant: local (with the notes in their records wrapper) or cloud (ids and bands only, no
notes). The snapshot lives in this object only: it is never checkpointed, so a restored session freezes afresh. The
one change a frozen snapshot allows is a forgotten note leaving it (`without_note`).

A session reaches memory only through `MemoryAccess`, bound to the profile the session belongs to: when the open
learner database is another profile's (after a switch), every read refuses. Whether saving is on is read again for
every turn, because it governs an action (MEM-03), and reaches the Coach as one line of the per-turn block.

Also here, because both are about what the tutor may claim: the explicit "remember that ..." request (MEM-06,
MEM-11), and the critic that takes a claim of having saved something out of a reply (PRM-17, LRN-04, MEM-23). Only
the engine announces a save, with `memory.saved`; the model's words never do.
