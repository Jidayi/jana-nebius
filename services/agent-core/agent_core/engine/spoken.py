"""Reading maths written or spoken in words back into symbols (AGT-09, AGT-10; the inverse of the VOC-08 conventions).

The leak gate and the claim check read every surface a student can read or hear. A value can be written as digits,
as LaTeX (`\\frac{49}{2}`, `2.45 \\times 10^{1}`) or in words ("twenty-four point five", "forty-nine over two", "two
minus two is four"). `to_written` turns the words into symbols in place, so the same numeric checks apply to all three:
number words become digits, and operator words between numbers become operators ("is" and "equals" become `=`).
Everything else in the text is left as it was. `latex_to_plain` turns the LaTeX forms into plain arithmetic."""
