"""Speech-linked pointing: the cue markers of an accepted spoken form, resolved to ids on screen (VOC-10, VSL-45).

The Coach marks its spoken form with `<point at="REF"/>` (point at REF from the next word on) and
`<write at="REF">words</write>` (the words that cite a new board line, D103 write cues). This module never accepts a
candidate: it reads the spoken form of a turn Finalise already accepted, after its board and visual operations were
applied, and turns each marker into a cue with a character offset into the exact text sent to speech. A REF resolves
to exactly one element on screen or to nothing:

- a board step: the `stp_` id, or the step's number as tutor-context lists it (`3` or `board 3`, the integer ref of
  MEM-08), on the accepted board; a tutor line that is unchecked or a draft is never pointed at (UXS-64, AGT-10);
- a part of a visual shown for this problem: `vis_<id>:<part>` (the UXS-58 form), or a bare part id when exactly one
  shown visual has that part.

Anything else (unknown, no longer shown, matching several elements) draws nothing and is reported as a miss with a
reason code (VSL-45); the spoken words already name the place, so nothing the student needs is lost. A write cue is
only for a tutor line this turn added; on any other line it is kept as a point. Cue timing is the client's job: it
fires each cue from actual playback progress (VOC-51). Markers never reach speech, a log or a trace.
