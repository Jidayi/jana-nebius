"""The S2 flows on the live turn loop (AGT-19, PED-22, PED-24, PRV-13 `beyond_level`, LRN-26).

`tutor_flows` holds the flows as state machines; this module is where the running engine takes their edges. From S2
(the build stage, `Settings.build_stage`) a new problem in guided mode gets its own `GuidedFlow`, and every point of
the turn path the diagram names moves it: the input guard, the Diagnoser (and its clarifying question), the plan's
checks, the student's reply (answer, "I'm stuck" or a side question), the code's verdict and the wrap-up. A wrong
answer is where the engine raises the rung or targets a misconception; a matched misconception runs the PED-22 flow,
whose evidence goes to the learner model; and the saved-question triggers of PED-24 that the engine's signals reach
(the stuck cap, a misconception that survives its fixes, a question outside the installed content) save one local
question each. A node the diagram has no edge to is logged and skipped: the flow never fails a turn.

Everything here is engine code over engine state (AGT-03): no model chooses an edge."""
