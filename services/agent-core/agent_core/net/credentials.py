"""Device credentials for online services (SEC-21).

When an adult enables an authenticated online feature the device generates an Ed25519 service-credential key pair,
keeps the private key in the keystore under its own reference (never a database key or the backup key, SEC-32) and
registers the public key with the gateway, bound to the licence. Requests carry short-lived access tokens obtained
by signing a fresh challenge; the token, never the key, is sent. Anonymous features (downloads, update checks,
telemetry, crash reports) never carry the credential or any other device identifier: the policy refuses a request
that tries (`credential_on_anonymous_feature`). A credential revoked through the licence portal can obtain no new
token and its tokens stop working; the client then forgets it.

Every body the device sends to the gateway is built through the gateway contract's models and every reply read
through them (D39): a reply that does not match is a refusal (`CredentialRefused`), as is registering with no
subscription entitlement, which the `DeviceRegistration` contract requires (D70)."""
