"""Cloud voice: the core's online Realtime connection (VOC-28) and its side of the desktop voice tunnel.

The voice bridge talks to whatever `RealtimeConnection` it is given; this module gives it one to our hosted voice
endpoint, with the same frames as the local sidecar's (VOC-25, VOC-27), so neither the bridge nor the UI changes. The
connection is the `cloud_voice` feature of the connectivity layer (ARC-06, ARC-07): it opens only while the switch is
on, the open profile holds an active `cloud_voice` consent and a subscription covers it, and its first-use notice
was accepted (ARC-10, PRV-05). Before the socket is dialled the session stream hears `egress.notice started` naming
`audio` and `transcript`, so no audio frame leaves before the student is told (VOC-28); the ledger records the
connection, and `ended` follows its close.

Transport (SEC-31): TLS 1.2 or later against the bundled CA set, no proxy, no compression, and the server's chain is
checked against our pinned keys right after the handshake, before the upgrade request (which carries the access
token) is written.

The language-model slot (VOC-31): the endpoint forwards each chat-completions request its pipeline would send to the
engine adapter as a `jana.voice_llm.request` frame. This connection answers it from the core's own adapter, in
process, and streams back the adapter's chunks: the tutor turn, the learner model and every gate stay on the device;
only the accepted spoken words go up, to be spoken. Tunnel frames never reach the bridge."""
