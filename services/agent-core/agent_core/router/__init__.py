"""agent_core.router: the only path to a model (ARC-20, MDL-01 to MDL-30).

Every call goes through `Router.complete`, which refuses to run outside an engine turn or job scope. The guard is
unconditional: there is no flag, environment variable or test switch that turns it off. The module-level `complete`
and `stream` reach the router the engine installed with `install`; before one is installed they fail with
`NoProviderError`."""
