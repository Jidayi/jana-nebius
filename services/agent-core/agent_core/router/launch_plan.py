"""The runtime's launch attempts (MDL-16 to MDL-19): the verified model the shell starts, and the next smaller one.

Each verified model's GGUF header is read (under the parser rules of SEC-24) and the highest context rung that fits
memory and the class cap is chosen (MDL-17, MDL-18); a model that cannot fit the agent minimum is left out. The
largest model that fits is the first attempt and the next smaller one the single fallback the shell may try after the
restart limit (MDL-19). Arguments are `launch_arguments` without the port and the key file, which the shell sets for
each launch. This module only reads files; the core writes the plan and the shell acts on it."""
