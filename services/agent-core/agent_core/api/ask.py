"""The one Home input's routes (UXS-67) and Ask anything (STU-20, D117).

- `POST /v1/ask/route` {text}: where the box's words go (`tutor`, `study` or `ask`) and whether Ask anything can run
  now. Read-only and local: nothing is stored or sent.
- `POST /v1/ask` {question, mode?, reach?}: the question is routed again here, so a question in an installed subject
  is handed to the tutor with no answer whatever the app asked; any other question is answered by the online feature
  `ask_anything` under the profile's policy. The reply is always 200 with a `state`: `answered`, `unavailable`
  (offline, no online plan, consent or notice missing, allowance used up) or `failed`.

The input guard runs on the question in the API's mutating wrapper before anything else (`screening.ROUTES`)."""
