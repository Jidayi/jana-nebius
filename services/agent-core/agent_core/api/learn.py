"""The subject map and the lesson player over the local API (UXS-22, UXS-23): the map of one subject with each
KC's mastery state, one lesson with its saved position, a quick check marked by the deterministic marker, and
saving the position.

Every route acts for the profile whose learner database is open (the profile token when profiles exist, API-04); a
locked device answers `profile_token_expired` before anything is read (`ProfileScope`). The bodies are checked here
against the command contract's own definitions where it has them (`Answer`) and by shape where the proposal adds
them, since the contract has no definition to validate them against yet."""
