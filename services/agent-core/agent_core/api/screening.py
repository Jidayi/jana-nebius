"""The input guard on every free-text student route outside a tutor turn (PRV-13, PRV-14, STU-11, VOC-20).

Every route of the local API that takes something a student wrote is named in `ROUTES`, with how the input guard
reaches it:

- `Screened`: the guard runs here, in the API's one mutating wrapper, before the command touches anything. The
  categories the surface refuses end the command with their template (`validation_failed`, reason
  `safety_template`, the template id and whether the calm screen shows); nothing is stored or marked. Distress is
  handled wherever it is written (PRV-14): the lesson flow stops, `safety_flagged` records the category and the
  template only, and a session the input belongs to gets the calm-screen notice.
- `Turn`: the text becomes a tutor turn (or is carried into one), and the engine's guard decides it before any model
  call (`Engine._screen`, PRV-13, PRV-18 layer 1).
- `Exempt`: the body carries no student-written text (ids, enums, numbers, files, names of things), or the text
  reaches neither a model nor storage; the reason is stated.

Scope differs by surface (PRV-13 owns the categories): an answer box is not a chat, so an answer is refused only for
distress, and is otherwise marked as the student wrote it. Study notes and dictated notes follow the study area's
rule (STU-11): distress, harmful requests, sexual or violent content, medical and legal advice and cheating requests
get their templates; personal details are redacted (PRV-20) and the note is kept. A problem report is never refused,
since reporting unsafe output is its purpose (UXS-44); a disclosure in it still gets the calm screen.

`tests/test_a1_input_routes.py` builds the app and fails when a route that takes a body or a text query is missing
here, so a new route cannot skip the guard."""
